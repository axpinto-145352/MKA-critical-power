## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Who Is Michael Archie?

Michael Archie is an **AI data center infrastructure ecosystem architect** — a one-of-one role in a white-hot market. He doesn't sell components. He doesn't install equipment. He assembles scattered critical infrastructure technologies — power, cooling, micro-nuclear, modular compute, hybrid transformers — into integrated, bankable, deployable systems for the buyers who actually deploy AI infrastructure at scale.

### Why Rebrand?

- **MKA Critical Power** anchors the brand to a founder's initials and a single technology category (power), when the value proposition is much broader — full ecosystem architecture
- The current domain (mkacriticalpowers.com) is trapped behind a registrar (DomainPeople/IncAuthority) with no direct access
- The name doesn't convey the strategic, C-suite advisory nature of the work
- Mike is positioning as a **thought leader**, not a power equipment vendor — the brand must match the ambition
- Fresh start = clean domain, clean social handles, clean positioning

### What This Document Delivers

- 10 recommended company names with rationale, domain availability guidance, and brand personality
- Complete visual identity direction (colors, typography, logo concepts) for the top 3 names
- Full social media and content strategy for thought leadership
- SEO/GEO strategy to dominate AI infrastructure search (both traditional and AI-powered search)
- Legal, ethical, and technical guardrails for federal consulting work
- Step-by-step transition plan from MKA Critical Power to the new brand

## 2. MARKET RESEARCH & LANDSCAPE

### 2.1 The AI Infrastructure Boom — By the Numbers

| Metric | Value | Source/Context |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Global data center market (2025) | ~$350B | Growing 20%+ CAGR |
| AI data center construction (2024-2030) | $250B+ projected investment | McKinsey, Goldman Sachs estimates |
| U.S. data center power demand (2030) | 35-45 GW (up from ~17 GW in 2023) | DOE, IEA projections |
| Liquid cooling market (2030) | $15-20B projected | From ~$3B in 2024 |
| Small modular reactor market (2035) | $150B+ projected | Nuclear Energy Institute |
| Federal AI infrastructure spending | $500B+ (Stargate initiative alone) | White House announcements |
| Per-rack power density for AI | 50-150 kW (vs. 5-10 kW traditional) | Industry standard |
| Data center cooling share of opex | 30-40% | Industry standard |

### 2.2 Key Market Trends (2025-2030)

**Power Crisis Is THE Story:**
- AI workloads are driving 10-15x power density increases per rack
- U.S. grid capacity cannot keep pace — 3-5 year lead times for new transmission
- This has created a gold rush for alternative power: micro-nuclear (SMRs), on-site generation, battery storage
- Major deals: Microsoft/Constellation (Three Mile Island restart), Google/Kairos Power, Amazon/Talen Energy, Oracle's nuclear-powered data center plans

**The Cooling Revolution:**
- Air cooling is physically incapable of handling 50+ kW racks
- Two-phase liquid cooling (direct-to-chip) is becoming mandatory for AI/HPC
- Players: GRC, Iceotope, CoolIT, LiquidCool Solutions, Asetek, ZutaCore
- Market shifting from "nice to have" to "must have" for any new AI deployment

**Federal AI Infrastructure:**
- Stargate initiative: $500B commitment for AI infrastructure in the U.S.
- DOE national laboratories upgrading to AI-capable HPC
- DoD investing in AI/ML for defense applications
- CHIPS Act driving domestic semiconductor manufacturing (which needs data center support)
- DOE loan programs available for clean energy data center projects

**The Integration Gap (Mike's Sweet Spot):**
- Technology companies are siloed — power vendor doesn't talk to cooling vendor doesn't talk to compute vendor
- Buyers (especially federal) need integrated, qualified, compliant solutions
- No recognized category exists for "ecosystem architect" — Mike is creating the category
- The closest analogy is an **EPC (Engineering, Procurement, Construction) architect** but for technology ecosystems rather than physical construction

### 2.3 Buyer Persona Analysis

#### Persona 1: Federal Program Manager (DOE/DoD)
- **Pain:** Needs AI infrastructure but bound by FAR/DFARS procurement rules, NEPA compliance, security requirements
- **Buying Journey:** 12-36 months, RFI → RFP → evaluation → award → deployment
- **What They Need:** Pre-integrated consortia that already meet compliance requirements, with a clear technical architecture and bankable cost model
- **How Mike Helps:** Assembles the consortium before the RFP drops, shapes the opportunity, brings pre-qualified technology partners

#### Persona 2: Hyperscale/Enterprise Infrastructure VP
- **Pain:** Board mandated AI deployment yesterday, but power and cooling at scale are 2-3 year problems
- **Buying Journey:** 6-18 months, strategic assessment → vendor evaluation → pilot → scale
- **What They Need:** Proven technology stacks that work together, not 15 separate vendor evaluations
- **How Mike Helps:** Brings the integrated ecosystem — "here's your power, cooling, and compute stack, pre-validated, with deployment timeline"

#### Persona 3: PE/VC Infrastructure Investor
- **Pain:** Wants exposure to AI infrastructure but can't evaluate the technology landscape or identify winning combinations
- **Buying Journey:** Ongoing deal flow evaluation, 3-6 month diligence cycles
- **What They Need:** Technical diligence, market intelligence, deal flow, portfolio construction advice
- **How Mike Helps:** Serves as technical advisor, identifies investment-ready technology combinations, validates engineering approaches

#### Persona 4: Emerging Tech Company (Foreign OEM / Startup)
- **Pain:** Has a breakthrough technology (cooling, nuclear, transformer) but no U.S. market access, no federal qualification, no ecosystem partnerships
- **Buying Journey:** 6-12 months to establish U.S. market presence
- **What They Need:** Channel architecture, strategic partnerships, federal qualification support, introduction to the ecosystem
- **How Mike Helps:** U.S. market entry architecture — partners, channels, compliance, first deals

### 2.4 Market Gaps & Opportunity

The critical insight: **There is no recognized category for what Mike does.** This is both a challenge and a massive opportunity.

- **Gap 1:** No "ecosystem integrator" brand exists between the technology OEMs and the end buyers. EPC firms do physical construction. Management consultants (McKinsey, Deloitte) write reports but don't build ecosystems. Mike does the actual assembly work.
- **Gap 2:** Federal buyers need pre-assembled consortia. Nobody is proactively building these before RFPs drop.
- **Gap 3:** Emerging technology companies (especially international) have no established pathway into U.S. federal markets.
- **Gap 4:** Investors lack technical advisors who understand both the technology AND the federal procurement landscape.

**Mike is creating the category.** The brand should name and own it.

## 3. COMPETITOR ANALYSIS

### 3.1 Direct Competitors (Independent Advisors/Architects)

The good news: **there are almost no direct competitors doing exactly what Mike does.** The ecosystem architect role at the intersection of federal procurement + AI infrastructure + multi-technology integration is essentially unoccupied.

**Closest competitors:**

| Competitor | What They Do | How Mike Differs |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Independent data center consultants** (various) | Site selection, design, power studies | Mike works at the ecosystem/deal level, not the engineering level |
| **Federal IT consulting firms** (Booz Allen, SAIC, Leidos) | Federal tech advisory, systems integration | They're massive firms — Mike is nimble, founder-led, with actual OEM relationships |
| **Power equipment reps/agents** (various) | Sell UPS, generators, switchgear | Mike sells ecosystems, not individual products |
| **Technology advisory firms** (Gartner, IDC) | Market research, vendor evaluations | They write reports; Mike builds alliances and closes deals |

### 3.2 Adjacent Companies & Brand Inspiration

These companies occupy adjacent space and offer brand positioning lessons:

### 3.3 Thought Leaders in the Space

Key voices Mike will be competing with (and should engage/differentiate from):

- **Data center power/infrastructure voices on LinkedIn:** Executives from Schneider Electric, Vertiv, Eaton discussing power trends; leaders from Equinix, Digital Realty on data center strategy
- **Nuclear for data centers:** Voices from NuScale, Oklo, Kairos Power, X-energy evangelizing SMRs
- **Liquid cooling advocates:** Leaders from GRC, Iceotope, CoolIT, ZutaCore
- **Federal tech voices:** Former DOE/DoD officials, national lab directors
- **AI infrastructure analysts:** Analysts from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, McKinsey publishing on AI infrastructure investment needs

**Mike's differentiation as a thought leader:** He's the ONLY voice talking about **all of these as an integrated ecosystem**. Everyone else is siloed in their technology category. Mike's content should consistently be the "zoom out" perspective — how these pieces fit together.

### 3.4 Naming Convention Analysis

What works in this space:

| Convention | Examples | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|---------|------|------|
| **Single aspirational word** | Anduril, Vantage, Compass, Shield | Memorable, ownable, scalable | Hard to find available domains |
| **Two-word compound** | Scale AI, Shield AI, Black Ridge | Descriptive + aspirational | Can feel generic |
| **Mythology/historical reference** | Anduril (LOTR), Palantir (LOTR) | Distinctive, story-rich, memorable | Pronunciation risk, pretension risk |
| **Founder name** | Lazard, Archie & Co. | Personal brand alignment | Doesn't scale beyond founder |
| **Acronym** | QTS, ICF, GRC | Short, professional | Forgettable, requires brand investment |
| **Category-defining** | Uptime Institute | Owns the category | Limits future expansion |

**Recommendation:** Mike should go with either a **single aspirational word** or a **two-word compound** that signals both authority and integration/architecture.

## 6. SOCIAL MEDIA & CONTENT STRATEGY

### 6.1 Platform Priority

| Priority | Platform | Why | Time Investment |
|----------|----------|-----|-----------------|
| **#1** | **LinkedIn** | Where every single buyer persona lives — federal PMs, PE partners, OEM executives, defense primes | 70% of effort |
| **#2** | **Newsletter (Substack or Beehiiv)** | Long-form thought leadership, email list ownership, SEO value | 15% of effort |
| **#3** | **X (Twitter)** | Real-time industry commentary, connect with tech/VC/policy community | 10% of effort |
| **#4** | **YouTube** (long-term) | Visual explainers, ecosystem architecture breakdowns | 5% of effort (start in month 6) |

**Not recommended initially:** TikTok, Instagram, Facebook (wrong audiences), podcast (high effort, start after year 1 if traction warrants).

### 6.2 Content Pillars (The "Big 5")

Every piece of content should map to one of these pillars:

#### Pillar 1: "The Integration Thesis"
*Why scattered technology approaches fail and integrated ecosystems win.*
- Post themes: Why buying best-of-breed components doesn't mean you have a solution. The assembly gap. Why RFPs fail when they're written for components instead of ecosystems.
- This is Mike's **signature thesis** — the idea he should own.

#### Pillar 2: "Power Is The Bottleneck"
*The AI power crisis — grid constraints, alternative energy, nuclear, and what it means for deployment timelines.*
- Post themes: Power density math (50-150 kW/rack × thousands of racks), grid interconnection queues, the nuclear renaissance, why "just build more substations" isn't a strategy.
- **Hot take to own:** "Every AI infrastructure conversation that doesn't start with power is a waste of time."

#### Pillar 3: "The Cooling Inflection"
*Liquid cooling isn't optional anymore — it's the physics.*
- Post themes: Air cooling physical limits, two-phase vs. single-phase, direct-to-chip economics, total cost of ownership analysis, which technologies win at which scale.
- **Hot take to own:** "If your data center partner is still talking about air cooling for AI workloads, find a new partner."

#### Pillar 4: "Federal Infrastructure Playbook"
*How federal AI infrastructure actually gets built — procurement, compliance, consortia, and the realities of DOE/DoD deployment.*
- Post themes: How federal procurement actually works (not how people think it works), what DOE/DoD buyers actually care about, how to structure consortia for federal bids, Stargate implications.
- **Hot take to own:** "The federal AI infrastructure market is $500B+. But 90% of tech companies have no idea how to access it."

#### Pillar 5: "Ecosystem Intelligence"
*Market moves, deal analysis, technology assessments, and what's actually happening in AI infrastructure.*
- Post themes: React to industry news (nuclear deals, cooling acquisitions, federal RFPs), technology assessments, market intelligence, "what I'm seeing" field reports.
- **Format:** These are timely, reactive posts that demonstrate Mike is in the arena, not watching from the sidelines.

### 6.3 Content Formats & Cadence

#### LinkedIn (5x/week)

| Day | Format | Pillar | Example |
|-----|--------|--------|---------|
| **Monday** | Text post (insight/thesis) | Integration Thesis or Power | "Here's what nobody tells you about building AI infrastructure ecosystems..." |
| **Tuesday** | Carousel (educational) | Cooling or Federal Playbook | "5 reasons liquid cooling is mandatory for AI racks [slide deck]" |
| **Wednesday** | Short text (hot take/reaction) | Ecosystem Intelligence | "[Company X] just announced [thing]. Here's what it actually means..." |
| **Thursday** | Long text or document (deep dive) | Any pillar (rotate) | "I built a $280M federal consortium in 12 months. Here's the playbook." |
| **Friday** | Personal/behind-the-scenes | Brand building | "What I learned this week / reflections on a deal / lessons from the field" |

**Post structure for LinkedIn (every post):**
1. **Hook** (first 2 lines — must stop the scroll)
2. **Tension** (the problem or counterintuitive insight)
3. **Evidence** (what Mike has seen/done/built)
4. **Framework** (the mental model or lesson)
5. **CTA** (question, invite to DM, or follow prompt)

#### Newsletter (1x/week — Thursday or Friday)

- **Format:** 800-1,200 word deep dive on one of the 5 pillars
- **Structure:** Industry context → Mike's analysis → implications → what to do about it
- **Name suggestions:** "The Baseload Brief" / "Converge Weekly" / "The Arc" / "Infrastructure Intel"
- **Distribution:** Email + republish on LinkedIn as article + post to personal site for SEO

#### X/Twitter (3-5x/week)

- Short-form takes, threads on breaking news, engagement with industry voices
- Repurpose LinkedIn content into Twitter-native format
- Use for networking with VC/tech/policy audiences that are more active on X than LinkedIn

### 6.4 Thought Leadership Frameworks to Own

Mike should develop and popularize these proprietary frameworks:

1. **"The Ecosystem Stack"** — His framework for how Power × Cooling × Clean Energy × Compute × Compliance must be architected as a single system. Visualize it as stacked layers. Reference it constantly.

2. **"The Bankability Test"** — A framework for evaluating whether an infrastructure solution is investment-ready. Does it have: integrated technology? Deployment timeline? Regulatory pathway? Cost model? If not, it's not bankable.

3. **"The Assembly Gap"** — The concept that the biggest gap in AI infrastructure isn't technology — it's assembly. The technologies exist. Nobody is putting them together. This is the core brand narrative.

4. **"The 5 Pillars of AI Infrastructure"** — Power, Cooling, Clean Energy, Compute, Compliance. Mike's proprietary categorization of what a complete AI infrastructure ecosystem requires.

5. **"The Federal Infrastructure Flywheel"** — How building one federal consortium creates the relationships, credibility, and technology partnerships that make the next one easier and bigger.

### 6.5 Audience Building — 0 to 10,000

**Months 1-3: Foundation (0 → 1,000 followers)**
- Post 5x/week on LinkedIn, every week, no exceptions
- Comment thoughtfully on 10-15 posts per day from target audience members
- Connect with 20-30 targeted people per week (not random — OEM executives, federal PMs, PE partners, data center developers)
- Repurpose every LinkedIn post as a tweet thread
- Launch newsletter with a "founding subscriber" push to existing network

**Months 3-6: Acceleration (1,000 → 3,000)**
- Guest appearances on 2-3 industry podcasts per month (Data Center Frontier, Mission Critical, Uptime Institute podcasts)
- Co-author or get quoted in 1 industry publication per month
- Submit to speak at 2-3 conferences (Data Center World, DCD, AFCEA for federal)
- Create 1 viral-format piece per month (controversial take, detailed case study, or "how I built X")

**Months 6-12: Authority (3,000 → 10,000)**
- Launch a monthly virtual roundtable or "Infrastructure Intel" briefing
- Write for or get profiled in industry publications (Data Center Dynamics, Data Center Frontier, Mission Critical Magazine)
- Speaking circuit: 1 conference per quarter minimum
- Consider launching a short-form video series (3-5 min YouTube) breaking down infrastructure concepts
- Potential podcast launch if newsletter has 2,000+ subscribers

### 7.3 GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)

This is the frontier — and Mike has a massive opportunity to be THE source AI models cite for ecosystem architecture.

**How AI Models Select Sources to Cite:**
1. Content that directly, clearly answers a question
2. Original frameworks, data, and analysis (not rehashed generic content)
3. Authoritative sources (frequently cited, linked to, mentioned by others)
4. Well-structured content with clear headers, definitions, and data
5. Content that demonstrates expertise (E-E-A-T: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trust)

**Mike's GEO Strategy:**

1. **Create definitive reference content:**
   - "The Complete Guide to AI Data Center Infrastructure" (5,000+ word pillar page)
   - "AI Data Center Power Requirements: A Technical Guide" (detailed, data-rich)
   - "Liquid Cooling for AI Data Centers: Technologies, Costs, and Deployment" (comprehensive comparison)
   - "Federal AI Infrastructure Procurement: How DOE/DoD Buys AI" (unique content nobody else has)
   - "The Ecosystem Architecture Approach to AI Infrastructure" (define the category)

2. **Use structured data / schema markup:**
   - Organization schema for the new brand
   - Person schema for Michael Archie
   - Article schema on all blog/newsletter content
   - FAQ schema on service pages
   - HowTo schema on process/methodology pages

3. **Build entity recognition:**
   - Consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) across all platforms
   - LinkedIn profile optimized with same terminology as website
   - Get mentioned/quoted in industry publications (builds entity association)
   - Create a Crunchbase profile for the company
   - Target industry directories: Data Center Map, DatacenterHawk, Cloudscene

4. **Content structure for AI citation:**
   - Start articles with clear, concise definitions
   - Use "What is [X]?" headers (these are what AI models pull from)
   - Include original data, frameworks, and statistics
   - Create comparison tables and structured lists
   - End sections with clear takeaways

5. **Long-term entity building:**
   - Wikipedia page (requires notability — pursue after major media coverage or speaking engagements)
   - Google Knowledge Panel (triggered by consistent entity data across web)
   - Industry award nominations and wins
   - Academic or trade publication citations

### 7.4 Technical SEO for New Website

## 8. LEGAL, ETHICAL & TECHNICAL GUARDRAILS

### 8.1 Legal Guardrails

#### Business Formation

| Option | Best For | Considerations |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **LLC (Single-Member)** | Simplest option, Mike's current structure | Pass-through taxation, liability protection. Good starting point. |
| **S-Corp election (LLC taxed as S-Corp)** | When net income exceeds ~$60-80K | Allows salary + distribution split, saves self-employment tax. **Likely the right move for Mike.** |
| **C-Corp** | Only if seeking VC/PE investment in the company itself | Double taxation, but cleaner for equity investors. Not needed unless Mike is raising capital for the firm. |

**Recommendation:** Form a new LLC for the new brand. Elect S-Corp taxation when revenue supports it. **Consult a CPA** — this is a tax optimization question that depends on Mike's specific financials.

#### Trademark & IP Protection

**MUST DO before launching the new brand:**

1. **Trademark search** — Run a search on USPTO TESS (free) for the chosen name in:
   - Class 35 (Business consulting)
   - Class 42 (Technology services)
   - Class 37 (Construction/infrastructure services)
2. **Domain acquisition** — Secure .com, .io, and .co variations BEFORE announcing the name
3. **Social handle reservation** — Grab LinkedIn company page, X/Twitter, and other handles immediately
4. **File trademark application** — $250-350 per class via USPTO TEAS Plus. Can self-file but **attorney review recommended** ($500-1,500)
5. **Protect proprietary frameworks** — "The Ecosystem Stack," "The Assembly Gap," "The Bankability Test" can be trademarked as methodology names

#### Federal Contracting Compliance

**CRITICAL — Mike must get these right if pursuing federal work:**

| Requirement | What It Is | Action Needed |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| **SAM.gov Registration** | Mandatory for any federal contracting. Must register the NEW entity. | Register immediately after forming new LLC. Takes 7-10 business days. Free. |
| **DUNS/UEI Number** | Unique Entity Identifier, required for SAM.gov | Obtained during SAM.gov registration |
| **NAICS Codes** | Industry classification codes for federal contracting | Key codes: 541611 (Management Consulting), 541690 (Other Scientific/Technical Consulting), 541330 (Engineering Services) |
| **ITAR/EAR** | Export control regulations — relevant if working with defense-related technologies | **Consult an export control attorney** if any technology partners are foreign companies selling to DoD. This is a serious compliance area. |
| **CUI Handling** | Controlled Unclassified Information — federal discussions may involve CUI | Need compliant email, document storage, and handling procedures. See Technical Guardrails below. |
| **CMMC** | Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification — increasingly required for DoD work | Level 1 (basic hygiene) may be required. Level 2 (NIST 800-171) for CUI handling. Start with Level 1 self-assessment. |
| **OCI (Organizational Conflict of Interest)** | Cannot advise a buyer and sell to them simultaneously; cannot advise competing bidders on same opportunity | **CRITICAL for Mike's model.** Must have clear OCI management plan. Discuss with federal contracts attorney. |

**Small Business Certifications to Consider:**
- **8(a) Business Development Program** — If Mike qualifies (socially and economically disadvantaged), this is a powerful federal contracting advantage. 9-year program with sole-source contract access.
- **HUBZone** — If the business is located in a historically underutilized business zone (check Coral Gables eligibility)
- **SDVOSB** — Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (only if applicable)

#### Securities Law — IMPORTANT

**If Mike is advising PE/VC on investments:**
- **Finder vs. Broker-Dealer:** If Mike receives transaction-based compensation (success fees, carried interest) for introducing investors to deals, he may need broker-dealer registration with FINRA/SEC. This is a **heavily enforced** area.
- **Investment Adviser Act:** If Mike is providing advice about whether to invest (not just introductions), he may need to register as an investment adviser or operate under an exemption.
- **Safe harbor:** Mike can advise on technical diligence (is this technology viable?) without securities registration. He CANNOT advise on "you should invest in X" and take a fee for it without proper registration.
- **Action:** **Consult a securities attorney** before structuring any PE/VC advisory fees. This is not a DIY area.

#### Contract & Liability

- **Professional Liability (E&O) Insurance:** $1-2M policy recommended. Costs ~$2,000-5,000/year for a solo consultant. Essential when advising on $100M+ infrastructure decisions.
- **General Liability Insurance:** $1M policy, ~$500-1,500/year. Often required by clients.
- **Cyber Liability Insurance:** Recommended given federal work and CUI handling. ~$1,000-3,000/year.
- **Consulting Agreement Template:** Have a federal contracts attorney draft a master services agreement with:
  - Clear scope of work definitions
  - Limitation of liability (cap at fees paid or insurance coverage)
  - IP ownership provisions (Mike retains his methodologies)
  - Confidentiality provisions
  - Conflict of interest disclosures
  - Termination provisions
  - Federal flow-down clauses (for subcontracting to federal primes)

#### Nuclear Industry Considerations

- Mike is advising on micro-reactor **deployment and integration**, not designing or operating reactors
- He does NOT need NRC licensing for advisory work
- However, he should be aware of NRC regulations and DOE nuclear energy policies when advising clients
- If any work involves nuclear facility access, he may need DOE "L" or "Q" clearance (security clearance)
- **Stay in the advisory lane** — architect and connect, don't engineer or certify

### 8.2 Ethical Guardrails

#### Conflict of Interest Management

This is Mike's BIGGEST ethical challenge given his ecosystem model:

| Scenario | Risk | Mitigation |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Advising multiple competing OEMs in same technology category | OEM A's proprietary info shared with OEM B | **Chinese walls** — separate engagement files, never discuss one client's strategy with another, disclose that you work with multiple cooling (or power, etc.) companies |
| Representing a technology to a buyer while compensated by the technology company | Buyer doesn't know Mike has a financial interest | **Full disclosure** — always disclose compensation relationships to all parties. Transparency is non-negotiable. |
| Advising on a federal opportunity while having relationships with potential bidders | OCI violations can result in bid disqualification or debarment | **OCI management plan** — document all relationships, disclose to contracting officers, recuse from conflicted roles when necessary |
| Advising PE/VC while also advising portfolio companies or targets | Insider information, front-running | **Information barriers** — separate advisory engagements completely, disclose potential conflicts |

**Rule of Thumb:** When in doubt, disclose. It's always better to over-disclose and let the client decide than to under-disclose and lose trust (or face legal consequences).

#### Claims and Marketing

| Claim | Can He Say It? | How? |
|-------|:-------------:|------|
| "$840M+ federal pipeline assembled" | Yes, with care | Say "assembled" or "developed" — do NOT say "won" or "awarded" unless contracts are signed |
| "Worked with DOE/DoD" | Yes, if true | Can reference the agencies generally. Do NOT name specific programs, contracts, or personnel without permission |
| "Presented to former Stargate CTO" | Yes, with care | Avoid naming the individual without their permission. "Presented to C-suite executives at major AI infrastructure programs" is safer |
| "5+ emerging tech companies onboarded" | Yes | Can state the number. Do NOT name the companies without written permission |
| Client logos on website | Only with written permission | Get logo usage rights in writing, even from companies you've worked with |
| "Trusted by DOE, DoD, Hyperscalers" | Only if contractual relationship exists | Listing agency names implies endorsement — use "Experience with" rather than "Trusted by" |

**FTC Guidelines:**
- All claims must be truthful and substantiated
- Testimonials must reflect typical results or include disclaimers
- Material connections (compensation) must be disclosed
- "Results not typical" disclaimers are needed if highlighting exceptional outcomes

### 8.3 Technical Guardrails

#### Cybersecurity Requirements

**For Federal Work (NIST 800-171 Alignment):**

| Control | What to Implement | Cost |
|---------|------------------|------|
| **Email Security** | Microsoft 365 Business Premium or Google Workspace Business Plus with DMARC, SPF, DKIM configured | $22/mo |
| **Encrypted Communications** | Use Microsoft Teams or approved platform for federal discussions. Signal for informal. NO regular SMS for CUI. | Included with M365 |
| **MFA Everywhere** | Enable multi-factor authentication on every account — email, cloud storage, banking, social media | Free-$5/mo |
| **Endpoint Protection** | Windows Defender (included with M365) or CrowdStrike Falcon Go (~$60/yr) | $0-60/yr |
| **Encrypted Storage** | Use OneDrive for Business or Google Workspace for document storage. Enable encryption at rest. | Included |
| **Password Manager** | 1Password Business or Bitwarden Business | $4-8/mo |
| **Backup** | Automated backup of all business data. Cloud backup with versioning. | $10-20/mo |
| **Mobile Device Management** | If accessing business email/docs on phone, enable MDM (Intune with M365 or equivalent) | Included with M365 BP |
| **Incident Response Plan** | Document what to do if a breach occurs. Who to call, what to report. | DIY |

**Minimum Viable Security Stack for Day 1:**
1. Microsoft 365 Business Premium ($22/mo) — covers email, storage, MFA, MDM, endpoint
2. 1Password Business ($8/mo) — password management
3. DMARC/SPF/DKIM configured on email domain
4. Separate devices for federal work (or strong MDM on personal devices)

#### Website Technical Requirements

| Requirement | What | Why |
|-------------|------|-----|
| **Privacy Policy** | Detailed policy covering data collection, cookies, analytics | Legal requirement (CCPA, GDPR if any EU visitors) |
| **Terms of Service** | Standard website terms | Liability protection |
| **Cookie Consent** | Banner with opt-in/opt-out | CCPA/GDPR compliance |
| **Accessibility** | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, Section 508 | Legal requirement for federal-adjacent, good practice |
| **SSL/HTTPS** | TLS certificate on all pages | Security baseline, SEO requirement |
| **Data retention policy** | How long you keep form submissions, analytics | CCPA/GDPR compliance |

#### Professional Certifications to Consider

| Certification | Relevance | Effort | Priority |
|--------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **PMP** (Project Management Professional) | Federal credibility for managing complex programs | Medium (exam-based) | Low — not critical for advisory role |
| **CDCP/CDCS** (Certified Data Center Professional/Specialist) | Data center industry credibility | Medium | **Medium** — adds legitimacy |
| **CEM** (Certified Energy Manager) | Energy/power credibility | Medium | Low |
| **Security Clearance** (DOE L or Q) | Required for classified federal work | Sponsor-dependent | **High if pursuing classified programs** — must be sponsored by a federal contractor |
| **LEED AP** | Green building/sustainability credibility | Medium | Low — nice to have |

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**Name:** Start with **Arcline**, **Baseload**, or **Converge** — validate domain availability, run trademark search, and get feedback from 5-10 trusted contacts. The name should feel right when Mike says "I'm Michael Archie, founder of [X]" on a call with a DOE program manager.

**Immediate next steps:**
1. Pick top 2-3 names from this list
2. Check domain availability (Cloudflare Registrar)
3. Run USPTO trademark search
4. Secure domains and social handles for the winner
5. Form the new LLC
6. Start building

**The most important thing:** Launch imperfectly and iterate. A "good enough" brand with consistent, excellent content will outperform a "perfect" brand that never launches.
