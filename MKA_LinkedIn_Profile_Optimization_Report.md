# MKA Critical Power — LinkedIn Profile Optimization Report
## Michael Archie | linkedin.com/in/michael-archie/

**Prepared by:** Claude AI (based on MKA Brand Strategy Report)
**Date:** February 2026

---

## Executive Summary

Michael Archie's LinkedIn profile currently positions him as a sales contractor, not the infrastructure ecosystem architect he actually is. This report provides specific, copy-ready changes to reframe the entire profile to match the brand strategy — from headline to cover photo to featured content. Every recommendation is designed to communicate one message: **Mike builds the integrated ecosystems that make AI data centers real.**

---

## 1. PROFILE PHOTO RECOMMENDATIONS

### Current Issue
The profile photo should project authority and technical credibility at the C-suite and federal level.

### Recommendations
- **Setting:** Professional headshot against a deep navy (#0A1628) or dark charcoal background
- **Lighting:** Studio-quality, slight side lighting to add dimension
- **Attire:** Dark blazer or sport coat, no tie — the look should say "executive who builds things," not "corporate banker"
- **Expression:** Direct eye contact, confident, slight smile — approachable authority
- **Framing:** Head and upper shoulders, centered
- **Technical specs:** 400x400px minimum, square crop, high resolution

### Why This Matters
At the $100M+ deal table, the profile photo is the first credibility check. A professional headshot against a brand-colored background immediately signals "executive," not "contractor."

---

## 2. COVER PHOTO / BANNER IMAGE

### Current Issue
The banner is likely default or generic. This is premium real estate — 1584x396 pixels of brand messaging that every profile visitor sees.

### Recommended Banner Design

**Layout (left to right):**

```

This version leads with proof points. Both work — the first is cleaner for a long-term brand asset; the second is stronger for immediate credibility.

### Tools to Create
- **Canva** (free tier works): Use custom dimensions 1584x396, apply brand colors manually
- **Figma** (free): More precise control for the grid/node motif
- **Adobe Express**: Quick template-based option

---

## 3. HEADLINE

### Current (Problem)
> "Expert Sales, On Demand"

This positions Mike as a freelance sales rep. It's the first thing people read after the name.

### Recommended (Option A — Strongest)
> **Founder, MKA Critical Power | AI Data Center Infrastructure Architect | Power × Cooling × Clean Energy Ecosystems for Federal & Enterprise**

### Alternative (Option B — Federal-Heavy)
> **AI Factory & HPC Infrastructure Architect | Assembling Power, Cooling & Clean Energy Ecosystems for DOE, DoD & Hyperscale**

### Alternative (Option C — Investor-Inclusive)
> **Chief Ecosystem Architect | AI Data Center Infrastructure | Power + Cooling + Modular DC + Clean Energy | Federal · Enterprise · PE/VC**

### Why These Work
- Lead with **Founder** — establishes ownership, not employment
- **"Architect"** instead of "Sales" — reframes the entire perception
- Keywords (AI Data Center, DOE, DoD, Clean Energy) are LinkedIn search-optimized
- The vertical bars create visual separation and scanability

---

## 4. CURRENT TITLE / POSITION

### Current (Problem)
Likely shows as "1099 Contractor," "Independent Sales Contractor," or similar. This is a credibility killer at C-suite and federal levels.

### Recommended Change
**Title:** Founder & Chief Ecosystem Architect
**Company:** MKA Critical Power, LLC
**Industry:** Information Technology & Services (NOT Utilities)
**Location:** Keep current

### Company Page
If no LinkedIn Company Page exists for MKA Critical Power, create one:
- Use the MKA logo mark as the company logo
- Use the same banner design as the personal profile
- Company description: the one-liner from the brand report
- Industry: Information Technology & Services

---

## 5. ABOUT SECTION

### Current (Problem)
Likely generic or sales-focused copy that undersells the actual scope of work.

### Recommended About Section (Copy-Ready)

> I build the infrastructure ecosystems that AI factories and HPC data centers need to actually get built.
>
> Most companies in this space have a piece of the puzzle — a UPS, a cooling solution, a transformer, a micro-reactor, a modular data center. What they don't have is someone who sees how all of those pieces integrate into a single, deployable, bankable system. That's what I do.
>
> In the last 9 months, I've:
> → Closed $390K+ in critical power equipment sales (MARTA Atlanta, Trinity River Authority TX)
> → Assembled a consortium targeting $840M+ in DOE national laboratory AI data center projects
> → Onboarded 5+ emerging technology companies into the U.S. federal market
> → Built first-of-kind alliances combining micro-nuclear reactors, two-phase liquid cooling, hybrid intelligent transformers, and modular data centers
> → Presented AI infrastructure blueprints to former Stargate CTO
>
> MKA Critical Power exists because the AI infrastructure race isn't won by individual technologies — it's won by integrated ecosystems with trusted architecture behind them.
>
> If you're deploying AI infrastructure, entering the U.S. market, or investing in critical power — let's talk.

### Formatting Notes
- Use the arrow (→) bullets — they render well on LinkedIn and stand out
- Keep paragraphs short — LinkedIn mobile truncates aggressively
- The "let's talk" CTA at the end drives inbound messages

## 6. FEATURED SECTION

The Featured section sits right below the About section and is highly visible. Use it strategically.

### Recommended Featured Items (in order)

1. **MKA Capabilities Statement (PDF)**
   - Create a 1-page PDF capabilities statement using the brand colors
   - Include: services, key metrics, partner ecosystem, contact info
   - Title it: "MKA Critical Power — Capabilities Statement 2026"

2. **Case Study Graphic or Post**
   - A carousel or single-image post summarizing one key win
   - Example: "How We Assembled a $280M Federal Consortium from Scratch"

## 9. CONTENT STRATEGY (WHAT TO POST)

### Content Pillars (Rotate Weekly)

| Day | Pillar | Example Topics |
|-----|--------|----------------|
| **Monday** | Industry Insight | AI power demand trends, grid challenges, PUE innovations |
| **Wednesday** | Ecosystem Story | How a cold call turned into a DOE consortium (anonymized) |
| **Friday** | Technology Spotlight | Explain one tech in the stack in plain English |

### Content Rules
1. **Write like you talk.** Mike's natural voice is his brand.
2. **Lead with the problem, not the product.** "AI factories need 50MW+ and the grid can't keep up" beats "We sell UPS systems."
3. **Show the ecosystem thinking.** Every post should reinforce that Mike sees the whole picture.
4. **One post per week minimum.** Consistency beats volume.
5. **Engage on 5 posts/day** in data center, critical power, and AI infrastructure spaces.

### Sample Post Template

```
[Hook — Problem Statement]
AI factories are demanding 50-150kW per rack. Traditional cooling can't keep up.

[Insight — Your POV]
But here's what most people miss: cooling doesn't exist in isolation.
The transformer, the UPS, the rack density, and the energy source
all have to be designed as one system.

[Proof — Your experience]
That's exactly what we did when we assembled [anonymized] — pairing
two-phase direct-to-chip cooling with hybrid intelligent transformers
and micro-reactor energy for a DOE AI deployment.

[CTA]
If you're building AI infrastructure and your power and cooling teams
aren't talking to each other — that's your biggest risk.
```

### First Post — Repositioning Announcement

```
I've been doing this work quietly for 9 months. Time to say it out loud.

MKA Critical Power doesn't sell boxes. We architect ecosystems.

Power. Cooling. Clean energy. Modular compute. Compliance.
We see how these pieces snap together into integrated, deployable,
bankable AI data center infrastructure — and we build the alliances
to make them real.

In 9 months:
→ $840M+ federal pipeline assembled
→ $390K+ in critical power equipment closed
→ 5+ emerging tech companies brought into the U.S. federal market
→ First-of-kind alliances built from scratch

The AI infrastructure race won't be won by individual technologies.
It'll be won by integrated ecosystems with trusted architecture behind them.

That's what we build. More to come.

## 12. COVER PHOTO DESIGN BRIEF (FOR DESIGNER)

If handing this to a designer, provide the following brief:

**Project:** LinkedIn Banner for Michael Archie / MKA Critical Power
**Dimensions:** 1584 x 396 px
**File format:** PNG (no compression artifacts)

**Brand Colors:**
- Background: Deep Navy #0A1628
- Primary accent: Electric Blue #0066FF
- Text: Signal White #F8F9FA
- Secondary text: Titanium Silver #B0B8C1
- Highlight (sparingly): Power Orange #FF6B2B

**Typography:** IBM Plex Sans Bold (headers), IBM Plex Sans Regular (body)

**Must include:**
- MKA logo mark (left side)
- Headline: "AI Data Center Infrastructure. Architected."
- Subtext: "Power × Cooling × Clean Energy × Modular DC Ecosystems"

**Visual motifs:**
- Subtle grid/circuit pattern in background (very faint, navy-on-navy)
- Connected node/network diagram on right side (3-5 nodes connected by thin lines, Electric Blue)
- Clean, dark, technical aesthetic — NOT corporate stock imagery
- No photographs, no gradients to white, no busy patterns

**Mood:** Defense-tech authority meets Silicon Valley innovation. Think: Anduril, Palantir, or Scale AI branding — dark, clean, confident.

**Safe zone:** Keep critical text and elements away from the left side below 400px wide and 200px tall — the profile photo overlaps this area on desktop.

---

## 13. BACKGROUND PHOTO GUIDANCE

LinkedIn's "background photo" is the same as the cover/banner image (Section 12 above). There is no separate background photo on LinkedIn — the banner IS the background.

However, if Michael uses a background photo in other contexts (conference bios, speaker pages, media kits), here are guidelines:

### Professional Photo (For Speaker/Conference Use)
- **Style:** Environmental portrait — Mike in a data center, server room, or at a whiteboard with infrastructure diagrams
- **Lighting:** Dramatic but professional, slight blue tint to match brand
- **Composition:** Three-quarter body shot or upper body, slightly angled
- **Background options:**
  - Active data center floor with server racks (preferred)
  - Conference stage or podium
  - Clean office with whiteboard showing ecosystem diagrams
- **Post-processing:** Slight cool color grade to match the navy/blue brand palette
- **Do NOT use:** Generic office backgrounds, outdoor casual photos, heavily filtered images
